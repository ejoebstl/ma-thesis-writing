This work investigates robust acoustic modeling for speech recognition systems based on hidden Markov models. The focus of this work is put on time delay neural networks. We first design a time delay neural network model for acoustic modeling and provide empirical results that justify our choice of design parameters. Then, we train the time delay neural network on augmented data, and compare its performance on reverberated data with conventional fully connected neural networks.
