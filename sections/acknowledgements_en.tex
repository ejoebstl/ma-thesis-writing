First, I would like to thank Prof. Dr. Alexander Waibel for his insightful advice and support. The foundation of the InterACT and CLICS exchange programs was foresightful, and I am proud to be one of many students who have greatly benefited from these programs. \\ \\
I would also like to thank my advisors, M.Sc. Markus Müller and Dr. Sebastian Stüker for their valuable input. I highly appreciate the critical feedback on the results obtained while working on this thesis. \\ \\
Interesting and important input was received during discussions with the team members of Carnegie Mellon's InterACT lab. I am very thankful that Florian Metze, Ramon Sanabria, Shruti Palaskar and Susanne Burger shared their practical knowledge with me. \\ \\
Last but not least, I would like to thank Martin Thoma for his critical questioning of my results and his excellent help with proofreading of this work. Furthermore, Martin's thorough public documentation of his own research work was of great practical help to me.
