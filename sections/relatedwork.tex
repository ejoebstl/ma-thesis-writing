This chapter will give a brief introduction to neural networks and time delay neural networks, as well as an introduction automated speech recognition with hidden Markov models. These are the necessary building blocks for the work presented in this thesis. At the end of this chapter, we will also briefly present research that directly inspired this work. 

\section{Neural Networks}

In machine learning research, the goal of a \textit{neural network} is to approximate arbitrary functions. The basic idea of neural networks, so called \textit{perceptrons}, were first introduced by Rosenblatt in \cite{rosenblatt1958perceptron}. While the first neural networks were biologically motivated, neural networks can be interpreted as composition of functions. The relation between these functions forms a directed graph. In this work, we will only cover \textit{feed forward neural networks}. They are called feed forward neural networks because there are no feedback connections: The relation between all functions in the neural network forms an acyclic directed graph. Feed forward networks are an important building block for many machine learning applications. 
\\
More formally, as described in \cite{Goodfellow-et-al-2016}, a feed forward neural network can be described as a model $y = f^*(x, \theta)$, approximating an existing function $y = f(x)$. In this example $x$ is the input, $y$ is the output and $\theta$ are the model parameters which are learned during training. $f$ is the function to approximate and $f^*$ is a composition of many functions with the parameters $\theta$. 
\\
In practice, the functions composing a feed forward neural network are often simply chained, so that their relation graph simply forms a path. In this case, the functional components are called layers. A feed forward neural network of this form with $n$ layers can be written as follows:

\[
y = f^*_n \dots (f^*_2(f^*_1(x, \theta_1), \theta_2) \dots, \theta_n)
\]

For this type of neural network, $f^*_1$ is applied to the input, then $f^*_2$ is applied to the output of $f^*_1$, until the final layer is reached. The output of the final layer is the output of the neural network. Figure \ref{fig:simple_feed_forward_nn} shows a graph based representation of such a neural network. Each node represents a function, arrows represent data flows.

	}

\end{minipage}


Even with this simplification, it has been shown that such a feed forward neural network can approximate any function with any desired accuracy. This is called the \textit{universal approximation theorem}, the proof can be found in \cite{hornik1989multilayer}. The caveat is finding the correct function $f^*_n$ to use in each layer and the correct parameters $\theta_n$. Also, finding the function to approximate is non-trivial in the first place. We will discuss these problems in the next sections. 

\subsection{Training Neural Networks}

Given the definition in the past section, we can treat the problem of training a given neural network as finding appropriate parameters $\theta$ to minimize a certain \textit{error function} or \textit{loss function} $E = \mathcal{L}(y)$, where $E$ denotes the error and $y$ the network output. The state of the art algorithm for optimizing the parameters of a neural network is called \textit{stochastic gradient descend}, a special application of regular \textit{gradient descend}. 
\subsubsection{Naive Gradient Descent}
To apply gradient descend, we have to calculate the derivative of the loss function, given a certain input, with respect to a certain parameter $\theta_i$. Since this derivative is multi-dimensional, it is called the \textit{gradient}. Given a feed forward neural network, we can write the error as follows:

\[
E = \mathcal{L}(f^*_n \dots (f^*_2(f^*_1(x, \theta_1), \theta_2) \dots, \theta_n))
\]

Thus, the derivative of the error with respect to a certain weight can be calculated by applying the chain rule.  

\[
\frac{\delta E}{\delta \theta_i} = 
	\frac{\delta \mathcal{L}}{\delta y_n}
	\frac{\delta f^*_n}{\delta y_{n - 1}}
	\dots
	\frac{\delta f^*_{i + 2}}{\delta y_i}
	\frac{\delta f^*_i}{\delta \theta_i}
\]

Where $y_k$ is the result of $f^*_k$. \\
We know that the gradient $\frac{\delta E}{\delta \theta_i}$ will become zero in a local minimum, local maximum or saddle point of our error $E$. Since the gradient also gives the direction of the steepest slope, we can simply update our parameters iteratively, until we converge into a local minimum. 

\[
	\theta_i = \theta_i - \epsilon * \frac{\delta E}{\delta \theta_i}
\]

The parameter $\epsilon$ is the so-called learning rate. It has to be chosen by the designer of the neural network and influences not only the speed of convergence, but also whether the network converges at all. In literature, propagating the error gradient through a neural network is called \textit{backpropagation}. Backpropagation in the context of neural networks was first described in \cite{werbos1974beyond}.

\subsubsection{Stochastic Gradient Descend}

In practice, naive gradient descend does not work well, as described in \cite{wilson2003general}. The reason is that the function we seek to optimize when training a neural network is not convex and might have many local minima. Optimizing iteratively on a stationary error term makes this approach prone to falling into local minima. Furthermore, as with most machine learning approaches, we define our error function by using some form of \textit{training dataset}. We usually do not want the neural network to excel on the training data set, but rather to perform well on unseen data. This ability is called \textit{generalization}. We can approximate the error on unseen data by testing the neural network on a \textit{test dataset}. The test dataset must never be used for adjusting the parameters, as this will make the test dataset worthless. \\ \\
The state of the art algorithm for training neural networks is called \textit{stochastic gradient descent} (\textit{SGD}), which was first described in a context of neural networks in \cite{bottou1991stochastic}. Stochastic gradient descent introduces two fundamental changes and is. First, we no longer calculate our error term and corresponding gradient for the whole dataset, but for a randomly sampled subset of our data set, which is called a \textit{mini batch}. Second, we decrease our learning rate while training progresses. According to \cite{Goodfellow-et-al-2016}, iterating on mini batches adds noise to our error term, which in turn offers a regularization effect which was shown to lead to better generalization. A disadvantage of stochastic gradient descend is the slower convergence. In practice, we usually shuffle our dataset, split it into mini-batches, and then process each mini batch once. An iteration over all mini batches in the dataset is called an \textit{epoch}. 

\subsubsection{Learning Rates and Learning Rate Scheduling}

With stochastic gradient descend, we choose a separate learning rate $\epsilon_k$ for each epoch $k$. In the scope of this work, we only introduce \textit{exponential decay}, a very simple scheduling algorithm for the learning rate, although numerous other schedulers exist. \\
Exponential starts with a learning rate $k_0$ for the initial batch and multiplies the learning rate by a factor of $0 < p < 1$ after each epoch. 
\[
k_n = k_{n - 1} * p
\]
A variant of exponential decay keeps the learning rate constant for a number epochs, until the improvement of error measured on the test dataset falls below a certain threshold $t$. This variant is called \textit{newbob}. Newbob scheduling is widely used by the speech recognition community. It was first introduced in \cite{berkely2000newbob}.

\subsection{Neural Network Architectures}

In practice, neural network layers are often formed by combining an affine transformation with a non-linear function. Since affine transformations of data vectors can be interpreted as matrix-vector multiplications, we can write a layer function in the following way, where $x_k$ is the input vector for $k$th layer, $W_k$ is the matrix defining the affine transformation of the $k$th layer, and $\varphi$ is a non-linear activation function of layer k.
\[
f^*_k(x_k) = \varphi_k(W_k x_k)  
\]
The count of layers, as well as the size of each $W_k$ are design decisions and depend on the task. We call the count of layers \textit{depth} of a neural network, and count of rows in $W_k$ the \textit{width} of layer $k$. The contents of $W_k$, called the \textit{weights} of layer $k$, are the trainable parameters $\theta$ for models of this form.

\subsubsection{Activation Functions}

Non-linear activation functions, or simply \textit{activation functions}, can be roughly classified into two groups: Activation functions which are applied element-wise and thus do not change the dimension of the data, as well as activation functions which are applied on groups of elements of the input vector and change the dimension. The latter case is commonly fund with so called pooling functions. The choice of the activation function $\varphi$ has significant impact on the performance of a neural network and has been subject to many bodies of research, as summarized in \cite{thoma2017analysis}. In this work, we will only discuss the \textit{ReLU}, \textit{p-norm} and \textit{softmax} activation functions. 

\subsubsection*{Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU)}
% ReLU
\begin{minipage}{0.45\textwidth}
	\[\phi^{ReLU}(x) = \begin{cases}
	0 & x < 0 \\
	x & x \geq 0
	\end{cases}\]
	First introduced in \cite{krizhevsky2012imagenet}, ReLU nonlinearities have proven successful in practice. The computation of ReLU nonlinearity is cheap, also the gradient never saturates for positive values of $x$. For negative values, the gradient is zero, which can be a disadvantage.

% L2 Pooling

\subsubsection*{P-norm}
\begin{minipage}{0.45\textwidth}
	\[\phi^{Lp}(X) = \sqrt[p]{ \sum_{x \in X}{x^p} } \] 
	The p-norm nonlinearity was described by \cite{zhang2014improving}. This nonlinearity operates on a set $X$ of input elements and reduces them to one. The group size as well as the $p$ are a design parameter. For a fixed $p$ of $2$, the p-norm is also called \text{L2 pooling}.

{sqrt(x * x + y * y)};

\subsubsection*{Softmax}
\begin{minipage}{0.45\textwidth}
	\[\phi^{softmax}(X)_i = \frac{e^x_i}{ \sum_{x_j \in X} e^x_j } \]
	The softmax activation is defined as an operation over the whole input, but does not reduce the dimension. It maps all output values to a space between $0$ and $1$, preserves the rank of each output and also guarantees that the sum over all outputs is exactly $1$. Therefore it produces a valid probability distribution and is usually used for the last layer of a neural network for classification problems.

\subsection{The Cross Entropy Loss Function}

There exist numerous loss functions for neural networks. Technically, any metric can be used as loss function, although loss functions do not necessarily have to be metrics. One of the most widely loss functions for classification tasks is the \textit{cross entropy} (\textit{CE}) function. For two  probability vectors $p$ and $q$, the cross entropy can be written as follows:

\begin{align}
H(p, q) = - \sum_{x} p(x) \log q(x)
\label{eq:cross_entropy_loss}
\end{align}

The cross entropy loss function has several important properties. First, it minimizes the so called \textit{Kullback-Leibler} (\textit{KL}) divergence. The Kullback-Leibler divergence measures the distance of two probability distributions and was introduced in \cite{kullback1951information}. The Kullback-Leibler divergence is equal to zero if, and only if, the two given distributions are also equal. For two probability vectors $p$ and $q$, it can be written in the following way:

\[
D_{KL}(p, q) = -\sum_{x} p(x) \log \frac{p(x)}{q(x)}
\]

To show the connection between the cross entropy and the Kullback-Leibler divergence, we first assume that $q$ is the distribution we seek to optimize. This, $q$ is the distribution given by our training data, and can be assumed to be constant. We can also write the Kullback-Leibler divergence as follows: 

% TODO: This formula has a syntax error. 
\begin{align*}
D_{KL}(p, q) &= -\sum_{x} p(x) \right[ \log p(x) - \log q(x) \left] \\
& = -\sum_{x} p(x) \log p(x) -\sum_{x} p(x) \log q(x)
\end{align*}

Since we are not interested minimizing the distribution $p$, we can drop the first sum, and thus receive the cross entropy loss as in equation \ref{eq:cross_entropy_loss}. \\ \\
When training neural networks, we often deal with classification problems. In this case, we seek to assign a single class to a given input sample, our target probability $p$ has exactly one element which is one, all other elements are zero. In this case, the cross entropy loss can be simplified to the so called \textit{negative log likelihood loss}, where $i$ is the index of the correct class in $p$. 

\[
D_{NLLL}(i, q) = -\log q(i)
\]

It has to be noted that this loss functions all operate on probability vectors: All elements have to be between $0$ and $1$ and sum to unity. Therefore, a softmax activation function is usually applied before calculating the loss.
