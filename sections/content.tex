\chapter{Approach}
\label{ch:approach}
This chapter describes our approach for acoustic modelling using TDNNs on a high level. 
We will also give a brief overview over unknown hyperparemters and design decisions,
as well as a coarse overview over the structure of our implementation. 

\chapter{Experiment Setup}
\label{ch:experiment_setup}
This chapter should describe the detailed preleminaries and hyperparemters of our training and evaluation setup:
\begin{itemize}
    \item which data, and which preprocessing was used
    \item how was the data reverbed
    \item which learning rate schedulers, optimizers, loss functions were used
    \item which mechanisms were used to make the training faster and scalable
\end{itemize}
